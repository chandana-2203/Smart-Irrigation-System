# 💜✨ Smart Irrigation System  
### *Patent Published · High-Level Overview*

This repository provides a concise and high-level overview of a Smart Irrigation System designed to automate irrigation based on real-time soil and water-level conditions. All confidential or patent-protected information has been intentionally excluded.

---

## 🌿 Overview

This project focuses on optimizing irrigation by sensing the soil’s moisture level and the tank’s water level. Based on the detected conditions, the system activates or deactivates the pump to ensure efficient water usage and reduce manual intervention.

### ✨ Block Diagram Description

- **Soil Moisture Sensor** → Sends moisture level readings to the Arduino Uno.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** → Measures distance/water-level height and reports to Arduino.  
- **Water-Level Sensor** → Monitors tank water availability.  
- **Arduino Uno** → Central unit processing all sensor inputs.  
- **Relay Module** → Controls the pump based on signals from the Arduino.  
- **Pump** → Activates or stops according to soil and tank conditions.  
- **Blynk Application** → Displays real-time system status to the user.

## 📸 Results (Combined Image)



### ✨ Results Description

- **Dry Soil Condition:** Low moisture triggers the pump to begin irrigation.  
- **Wet Soil Condition:** Adequate moisture is detected and the pump is deactivated.  
- **High Tank Water Level:** The tank is full, so the refill pump automatically stops.  
- **Low Tank Water Level:** Low water availability activates the refill mechanism.  
- **Serial Monitor Output:** System readings and responses are logged for verification.
